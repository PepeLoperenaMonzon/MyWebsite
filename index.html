            <p>
				My name is Jose Loperena Monzón but everyone calls me Pepe. I am a 24-year-old which finished his studies
                on Information Technology (IT) in 2024. I am fluent in 2 languages. I have been speaking English since I was 3 years old 
                and Spanish is my native language. I am passionate about IT and always eager to learn more about the newest technologies in the industry.

            <p>
                I am a passionate software developer specializing in Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, TypeScript, and React. 
                My focus is on building scalable, high-performance applications while optimizing backend architecture and enhancing user experiences. 
                I am eager to deepen my expertise in cloud technologies, system design, and modern development practices. Driven by continuous learning, 
                I thrive in collaborative environments that push the boundaries of innovation.

			<h3 class="major">What else do I do?</h3>
			<p>
				Outside of coding I really enjoy cooking, Basketball and going to the Gym. I am also getting into boxing
				as it is a sport I have always had curiosity for. I am also a big fan of music and tried to compose some
				music from time to time. When time permits it, I also enjoy gaming with old colleagues from school or
				university games such as Valorant or Overwatch.

            <h2>Work experience</h2>
            <h3>ZenZorrito</h3>
            <p>
                 <p><b>April 2024 - April 2025</b></p> 
                 Developing an application using the latest technologies such as Python and Django on the back-end. 
                 For the Front-end developing a user-friendly interface by using technologies such as TypeScript and react.  
            </p>
            <h3>ZenZorrito</h3>
            <p>
                <p><b>September 2023 - February 2024</b></p>
                Developed a Geocoding microservice to isolate all geocoding operations from the main codebase in ZenZorrito.
                Developed such microservice with the latest technologies such as Pydantic, Tornado Web API & celery. By creating
                this microservice, all geocoding operations where isolated ensuring higher uptime from the service. Code coverage
                was also increased as by isolating all geocoding operations it was possible to provide as much code coverage as
                possible. 2 different providers were used (Here API & Google Maps API). Differences on the result of the providers
                needed to be solved by also making the service as simple as possible. At the end, a microservice which used
                4 different ways of geocoding was developed and deployed into ZenZorrito´s production.
            </p>

            <h3>ZenZorrito</h3>
            <p>
                <p><b>February 2023 - June 2023</b></p>
                Finished working on a CI/CD pipeline project which made the feedback loop of the different engineers
                much shorter as well as improving the pipeline speed of the company making it much faster and improving
                the time that the different engineers need to wait for different steps that run on the pipeline.
            </p>

            <h3>ASML</h3>
            <p>
                <p><b>August 2021- January 2022</b></p>
                Worked in ASML in 5 subprojects where my problem-solving skills as well as
                Python skills were put into challenge. With this, I also developed my skills on the
                microsoft premises such as Sharepoint and TypeScript to develop a better Sharepoint page for the company.
            </p>

            <h3>Halqasid ltd.</h3>
            <p>
                <p><b>June 2016</b></p>
                Halqasid S.L. is a business which imports and sells equipment for people with physical disabilities.
                Here, I helped re-organising the database they had. Also,
                help them reorganize the layout of the products within this shop.
                From this I have developed different ICT skills such as the use and development of databases
                and the different skills required to constantly have it organized.
